Hardware Requirements
=====================

The resources Opencast needs highly depend on what and how much material you process on your cluster
and how you configured your Opencast.
Thus, treat this as a sensible starting point for testing out Opencast, nothing more.


Sensible requirements for an Opencast server:

- Virtual machine
- Four cores
- 8GB of memory

Additional notes about resources:

- Video processing is hard work and mostly profits from more CPU power
- More memory is only necessary for very large installations or with some special use-cases
